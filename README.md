**📖 Project Overview**

The Advanced Network Sniffer is a real-time packet analysis tool developed in Python to monitor, capture, and analyze network traffic at a low level.
This project demonstrates strong understanding of:
Network protocols
Packet structure
Raw socket programming
Traffic inspection techniques
Practical cybersecurity monitoring
It simulates how security analysts observe and analyze network communication in real-world environments.

**🎯 Project Objectives**

Capture live network packets
Extract critical packet metadata
Analyze transport-layer protocols
Display structured packet information
Build foundational penetration testing and monitoring skills

**🚀 Key Features**

✔ Real-time packet capture
✔ Source & Destination IP extraction
✔ TCP / UDP / ICMP protocol identification
✔ Port number detection
✔ Packet size monitoring
✔ Payload inspection
✔ Clean structured console output
✔ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows & Kali Linux)

**🛠 Technical Implementation**

The tool uses Python raw socket programming to intercept network packets.
It performs:
Socket initialization in promiscuous mode
Packet header parsing (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP)
Protocol-based classification
Metadata extraction
Real-time display in terminal
This project reflects practical understanding of OSI Model layers and packet-level networking.

**▶ Installation & Usage**

git clone https://github.com/Alpha-1928/Advanced-Network-Sniffer.git
cd Advanced-Network-Sniffer
python sniffer.py
(⚠ Administrator/root privileges required to capture packets.)

**📌 Real-World Relevance**

Network sniffing is a core technique used in:
Security Operations Centers (SOC)
Incident Response
Penetration Testing
Threat Hunting
Network Troubleshooting


****This project builds a practical foundation for advanced tools like Wireshark and enterprise monitoring systems.
This tool is strictly developed for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Unauthorized monitoring of networks without permission is illegal and unethical.**
